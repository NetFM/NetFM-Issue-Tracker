          <h3>10 Reasons Why Visitor Express</h3>
          <h4> </h4>
          <p class="left-align light">


                  <ul class="collapsible left-align " data-collapsible="expandable">
                  <li>
                        <div class="collapsible-header"><strong>1. Fast track queuing!</strong></div>
                        <div class="collapsible-body"><p>There are many pet hates the majority of us will experience when queuing 
                        <br>  
                        1) We get bored when we wait in line.   <br>
                        2) We really hate it when we expect a short wait and then get a long one.   <br>
                        3) We really, really hate it when someone shows up after us but gets served before us. 
  <br>  
                        Tackle these issues by incorporating some inspiring visual art or decor to prevent visitors becoming bored. Some businesses have sought to mitigate the latter two issues by offering buzzers, so visitors can entertain themselves elsewhere whilst assured they will be seen to next.</p></div>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                        <div class="collapsible-header"><strong>2. The power of using a name:</strong></div>
                        <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Ineffective greetings make visitors feel like a mere statistic, yet a warm greeting can have the power to lift a negative mood instantly. Furthermore, greeting people with their name is a sign of your respect for them. Combine the two, and the results can be magical. It can help people connect on a more personal level, which is of particular importance when greeting a stranger, as it can help them open up, break down defensive walls and be comfortable. It's amazing how a simple and effortless gesture can have a huge impact and pay off immediately.</p></div>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                        <div class="collapsible-header"><strong>3. Service with a smile:</strong></div>
                        <div class="collapsible-body"><p>It is essential that receptionists are highly affable. Dealing with anything from face to face contact to telephone enquiries, they should have excellent communication skills and be smartly presented. After all they are essentially the face of the company, and should therefore represent the company in the best possible manner. Receptionists should give a guest their full attention, maintaining eye contact and being fully engaged with what they are saying. While the saying 'service with a smile' is a cringe worthy cliché, it's impact is undervalued.</p></div>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                        <div class="collapsible-header"><strong>4. The environment within reception:</strong></div>
                        <div class="collapsible-body"><p>We all judge a book by its cover! So give your visitors positive feelings and impressions as they enter your office for the first time. Reception areas should be meticulously clean, clutter free, and have a desk or station where your visitors can be welcomed and make their arrival known. Where possible, avoid harsh lighting. Instead, opt for lights which brighten walls and help to make a reception feel more spacious. Similarly, colourful or shaped lamps and shades make an interesting focal point for your reception area, and can be used to add a colour or design feature. Cut flowers are also a great way to make a space feel more inviting. Purchase lasting displays from a local florist and replace them regularly to keep them fresh and fragrant.</p></div>

                  <li>
                        <div class="collapsible-header"><strong>5. Don't keep your guests waiting!</strong></div>
                        <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Be organised and efficient to ensure to keep visitors' waiting time to a minimum. Need to grab a refreshment? It can wait! While the reception area should mitigate visitor perception of waiting time, stick to schedule and don't drag out activities. Remember their time is just as precious as yours is!</p></div>
                  </li>


                  <li>
                        <div class="collapsible-header"><strong>6. Parking experience:</strong></div>
                        <div class="collapsible-body"><p>The parking experience is set to change beyond recognition over the next few years. Less time parking means less stress and happier customers. Flexible parking technology is currently pioneering the way visitors park, ensuring they experience a hassle-free parking prior to entering. Keep your car park litter-free, and have clearly marked-out parking bays and good signage.</p></div>
                  </li>



                  <li>
                        <div class="collapsible-header"><strong>7. Free refreshments:</strong></div>
                        <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Make sure visitors remember your business as one that caters for visitors in a unique way by installing a drinks chiller filled with refreshing beverages. Additionally, provide a bowl of complimentary fruit or snacks. Good quality coffee is always a nice touch for making clients, job candidates and guests feel welcome and energized. What's more, the aroma of coffee will delight most visitors as they step inside.</p></div>
                  </li>



                  <li>
                        <div class="collapsible-header"><strong>8. Music to my ears!</strong></div>
                        <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Silence in a reception can be stifling, particularly if the space is small. Install a radio or music system to provide background noise and help put visitors at ease. Music should have broad appeal. Keep it quiet though, so employees and visitors can have a conversation in the area.</p></div>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                        <div class="collapsible-header"><strong>9. Stay connected:</strong></div>
                        <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Wi-Fi should be free for visitors to use. Make sure details are visible as soon as visitors enter. Most reception areas will also offer visitors somewhere to plug in their laptops and phone chargers if they need to. Being able to offer visitors access to power can be essential, so this should be incorporated into the design of these areas. Go further and display your social media names in order to entice guests to follow you.</p></div>
                  </li>

                  <li>
                        <div class="collapsible-header"><strong>10. Freebies!</strong></div>
                        <div class="collapsible-body"><p>Branded Material on show gives your company a professional feel. Add a spot of pizzazz and have professionally designed stationery (notepads, jotters, pens etc.), with your company logo that can be given to the customer to keep for free! As well as being a nice gesture, it will also keep your business at the forefront of their minds.</p></div>
